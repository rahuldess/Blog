- ASCII table maintains the mapping of a character ( including symbols ) to its equivalent digit for 127 characters.
- "Extended - ASCII" can store unto 256 characters.

##### UNICODE:
- UNICODE is used to represent more characters from many languages which is impossible using ASCII standard.
- UNICODE has 8bit, 16bit, 32bit variations which increases the capacity that it can store.
- Along with different language characters, With increase usage of emoji’s, those are also part of UNICODE.
