<p>As you know, We can convert a digit to binary ( using Repeated Division-by-2 Method ) but how do we convert an Alphabet to its binary number?</p>

<p>Basically, ASCII table maintains the mapping of a character ( including symbols ) to its equivalent digit for 127 characters
Extended - ASCII can store unto 256 characters.</p>

<h5 id="unicode">UNICODE:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>UNICODE is used to represent more characters from many languages which is impossible using ASCII standard.</li>
  <li>UNICODE has 8bit, 16bit, 32bit variations which increases the capacity that it can store.</li>
